## Project Sought

I am actively seeking a challenging capstone project that allows me to leverage my strong foundation in computer science and software engineering. I am particularly interested in projects that involve innovative technology solutions, require a mix of technical and problem-solving skills, and have a positive impact on users and society. My diverse experience in software development, web applications, and embedded systems makes me well-equipped to contribute to projects that require a holistic approach to problem-solving and teamwork. I am excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of technology and provide meaningful learning opportunities.

I am interested in _**multi-disciplinary projects**_ that allows me to collaborate with a whole host of other engineers to create a solution to a real-world problem.
