The senior design project that Stephanie, Athulya, and I have decided upon is a
web-based karaoke application. The project aims to develop a web application that utilizes
advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to evaluate and compare a user's
vocal performance with the original song. This project not only incorporates web development
practices but also delves into the domains of sound engineering and data analytics. The
opportunity to engage in this multi-disciplinary project has offered us a comprehensive
experience, allowing our group to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, real-world context.
Given the intricacies involved, from capturing audio input to performing nuanced analysis, the
project promises to be a challenging yet rewarding endeavor.

My college courses will be a very useful tool for the Computer Vision-based aspects of
this project, as well as some positive experiences will the software engineering process. In
particular, my AI Principles and Applications (CS4033) and D&A of Algorithms (CS4071) will
guide the processes and coding aspects of Computer Vision. We will be leveraging OpenCV, an
open-source Computer Vision library, for this project. Additionally, my Software Engineering
(EECE3093) has given me knowledge of the software engineering processes that we will use to
properly track the work that we do on this project. Additionally, Software Engineering gave me
knowledge of AGILE-like processes that will be useful in the structure of this project.

My co-op experiences have provided me a vast array of knowledge in the AGILE
software development cycle. All four of my co-ops have been at FOX Sports (on the iOS app
team and the Android Mobile Player Framework team), where we used JIRA and an AGILE-like
software development cycle. The big takeaway from this is that I have a large amount of
knowledge in application development on both iOS and Android. While this app will be
web-based and use different programming languages, this app development experience will
guide me in my work on the web app. Additionally, I have work in hooking various APIs and
SDKs into our applications. This means that I will be able to effectively and adequately pull the
OpenCV API into our web application without issues.

For me, the big hook of this project is the work with Computer Vision. I’ve always been
fascinated by facial- and audio-recognition software, so I thought that using AI to do something
like this would be very exciting and interesting. Additionally, this allows for me to create my
own application, which would be a very good look on a resume, as well as great experience for
the work that I wish to go into in the workforce (app development). Ideally, I would like for our
team to have full functionality with little to no bugs. However, given that this is a complex
project, we may have to adjust our acceptance criteria over time. In terms of self-evaluation, I
want to do my absolute best to contribute at any chance I get. It’s difficult to self-evaluate, so I’ll
be counting on my teammates to ensure that I am putting in my full contribution; that isn’t to say
that I won’t be contributing and proactive, just that we will all keep each other accountable.

I see this project developing in two distinct pieces: the application and the Computer
Vision aspects. Each of these will be developed separately and then combined into one functioning
app. The web app is essentially a shell that contains the project, used mainly to display it in a
user-friendly format, while the CV portion contains all of the logic. We will know when we are
done after the project has minimal bugs and functions as expected. We will define our acceptance
criteria in further detail in the future. Lastly, my personal objective is to ensure that the
application is as user-friendly as possible and that the code is readable and efficient.
