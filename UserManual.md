# Background
Our web application is a blend of karaoke and dance that we believe many will enjoy. It invites users to not only sing along to their favorite songs but also to engage in the physical aspect of performing by emulating many popular dance poses. We believe that this dual approach will appeal to both music and dance enthusiasts, as well as those who simply wish to have fun and enjoy an interactive game with their friends.

# General Requirements
- Relatively quiet area with no people in the cameraâ€™s view
- Open space for posing (approximately 5 feet away from the camera with 3-4 feet of clearance each way)

# Hardware Requirements
- Functioning Computer
- Microphone (the better quality, the more accurate singing accuracy results will be)
- Camera (built-in laptop camera works fine, so long as movements can properly be picked up)
